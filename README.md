**Project 5 - Treehouse Front End Web Deveopment Techdegree**    
***Interactive Photo Gallery***

For this project, we were given mockups for what a photo gallery should look like with using a jQuery plugin for a lightbox.  We were also given the 12 photos with captions to be used.  The instructions were to create a gallery with the thumbnail images and set up a search box field to search through the photo captions.  Then add in a jQuery plugin of our choice for the lightbox and for the search functionality.  


***Exceeds Expectations***
* Use media queries to make this a mobile-first design.  I used two media queries, 1 at 768px and the 2nd at 1024px.
* Instead of using a jQuery plugin for the search, write your own with JavaScript or jQuery
  * I wrote mine with JavaScript
  * The search is set up to accept multiple comma separated values that have the leading and trailing spaces trimmed off, and are case insensitive.
  * Added a no results message.
